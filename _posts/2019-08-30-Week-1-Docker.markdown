# Week 1 Docker Blog

This week we were tasked with going over the docker install procedure used by the students in the CIT 160 class and define any potential areas of improvement.

The beginning of the instructions were pretty straight forward, however, if the student is a windows user they should be made aware that the commands they will be running are going to be executed using powershell. While other students can execute these commands in their terminal window for their OS, some windows users will need to enable some features to make it possible

The very first command is instructed to run on a terminal command or a docker shell which does not make much sense since the students reading this should not have docker or docker shell installed yet. Other than that the instructions were very easy to follow and simple. The whole assignment took a little under 30 minutes. I can see the console screenshots used to display what the commands should output being a helpful tool for someone who may not have much experience with command line environements.
